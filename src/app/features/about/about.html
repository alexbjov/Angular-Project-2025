    In the cobbled heart of Trastevere, a quiet Roman neighborhood where vines
    crept lazily over terracotta walls and espresso lingered in the air, there
    stands our old library and a book club with a history of over 50 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    It had once a large printing press but now it's been adapted to welcome
    readers from Italy and all over the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every Thursday evening, just as the sun dipps behind St. Peter's dome,
    groups of readers gather in our passionate book fan club.

  <p>
    Dear Reader, welcome to our home of books where you can find various books
    to
    enjoy and you can spend nice time in discussions with other members and
    online on this site.
